From Pen to Press
======
This project is a kiosk website for iPad. It will display a single manuscript, digitized from the collection of the Walters Art Museum in Baltimore, Maryland.
The iPad will be on view in the focus show, [From Pen to Press: Experimentation and Innovation in the Age of Print](http://thewalters.org/events/eventdetails.aspx?e=3614). 

This project is built from a previous project, which was an iMac display of 8 books for the focus show, "[Living by the Book: Monks, Nuns and their Manuscripts](http://thewalters.org/exhibitions/bythebook/)".

======

This folder should contain images of a digitized manuscript.
To get them, you can do something like this:


```
wget -r -l1 -nd -e robots=off -R*thumb* -A "jpg" http://www.thedigitalwalters.org/Data/WaltersManuscripts/92123/data/92.123/sap/
```

Note the book's unique ID 92.123 in that example.
